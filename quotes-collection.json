Add those weeks together, and 40 weeks later, you have a book, right? The difference between the prolific writer and the self-loathing person who doesn't write anything is one does 15 hours a week out of their 112 waking hours a week writing and the other one does zero out of 112 waking hours. So 1/7 versus 0/7. 6/7th of those two people's lives are the same. People who can't put something together have this daunting assumption that the prolific writer is fundamentally different, they're working constantly all the time. It doesn't have to be that way. It's consistency.",
